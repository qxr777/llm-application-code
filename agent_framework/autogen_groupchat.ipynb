Code Writing: It can be used to assist software developers in writing code by predicting the next line of code or even generating a whole function based on a prompt.\\n\\n3. Chatbots: It can be used to develop more intelligent and responsive customer service chatbots that understand the context and respond appropriately.\\n\\n4. Text Analysis: GPT-4 can be used to analyze and summarize large amounts of text data in a relatively short time, which could greatly help in data analysis software.\\n\\n5. Translator: It could be used to develop a software translator that could translate one language to another while keeping the context and idiom use intact.\\n\\nPlease note, these are potential applications and individual results may vary based on the exact capabilities and limitations of GPT-4 as described in the actual paper. \\n\\nLet me know if you need help with anything else.\", 'name': 'Product_manager', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'TERMINATE', 'name': 'Coder', 'role': 'user'}], summary='', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.25038, 'gpt-4-0613': {'cost': 0.25038, 'prompt_tokens': 8316, 'completion_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 8331}}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.25038, 'gpt-4-0613': {'cost': 0.25038, 'prompt_tokens': 8316, 'completion_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 8331}}}, human_input=[])"
